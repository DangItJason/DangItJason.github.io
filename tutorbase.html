            <div>
              TutorBase is a web-application that connects campus students to
              campus tutors. TutorBase's search functionality allows students to
              find tutors based on their desired subject, course and price range
              in under five steps. Think <strong>UpWork</strong> but for tutors.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our value is two fold: we provide tutors a business management
              tool that gives them a custom profile to market themselves to
              clients, visualize data metrics and change their weekly schedule
              times easily.
              <br />

              Tools: MERN Stack, Git/Github, npm, Agile

            <h3 class="mb-0">An Introduction</h3>

            <div>
              A college student has got to pay their loans somewhere - what
              better way to do it then teach others how to get an
              <strong>A</strong> in a course you just took! At first, I thought
              finding clients would be difficult because of the amount of
              academic resources RPI provides i.e. office hours w/ TA's. But a
              few paper adverisements and pieces of duct-tape later, I've got my
              first client! Sweet! My first client's session ends up going well
              so naturally I have to ask:
              <br />
              <br />
              "Why did you look to private tutoring for help?"
              <br />
              <br />"The office hours we're so crowded -
              <strong
                >I'm there for 2 hours and only get 10 minutes of help</strong
              >."
              <br />
              <br />
              And there behold was the problem - there's people who need help
              and not enough people to help them.
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />

            <h3 class="mb-0">A Solution</h3>
            <div>
              After that conversation, I knew personal connections and
              duct-taped advertisements weren't a long-term solution to finding
              clients. And after learning of the issue of the lack of supply of
              TA's and Tutors, I wondered if there was a way to connect
              (soon-to-be) tutors and clients in need. Afterall, most TA's
              qualifications had was that they recived an A/A- in the course.

              <br />
              <br />

              What if we connected clients with students who recieved an A/A- in
              the course? There isn't a lack of supply of theses available
              students and what broke college student is going to say no to
              giving Calculus I for $30/h?

              <br />
              <br />
            </div>

            <h3 class="mb-0">The Process</h3>
            <div>
              With this idea in mind, I talked to my CS buddy who was also a
              tutor. Given our background, we naturally gravitated towards a
              web-app based, software solution. And thus TutorBase was born!

              <br />
              <br />

              In the beginning of May, we pitched our idea to our department's
              Open Source development group and created a team to help develop
              our MVP and bring our idea to life.
