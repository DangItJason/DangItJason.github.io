                  <div> If you are alive during this time period, there's a good chance you are on a social media platform like Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter. Each platform I just named has a very addictive user journey. I often find 
                      myself scrolling aimlessly hours on end but over time liking pictures, reading captions and taking in information became a routine. I didn't need to give my full, un-divided attention to my phone and often times I'm just going through the motions.
                      But there are a few times where I stop scrolling and <strong>pay attention</strong> to what's on my screen. Gary Vaynerchuck's Instagram posts make me do this and it let me ask the question. What's Gary doing differently than other influencers?

                  <h3 class="mb-0">The Process</h3>
                  <div>
                      After finishing some core CS classes and having programming languages like Python and C++ under my belt, I decided it was time to put them to use!
                      I wanted to taking a data driven approach to this problem. I wanted to discover what was happening under the hood by finding connections and relationships in my data set.
                      Was there something he was doing that you can't see on the surface? Was he using certain words? Was it his frequency of posting? Is posting in the afternoon better than the morning? 
                      Maybe it was none of the above!
